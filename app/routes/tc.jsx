						PERMISSIBLE PURPOSE AND CONSENTS
					</h2>
					<p className="my-5">
						You understand and agree that, by establishing an
						account with CB, or submitting or enrolling for any
						Service, you have provided “written instructions” in
						accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act, as

						information may be obtained from Experian Information
						Solutions, Inc., TransUnion, LLC, and/or Dun &
						Bradstreet, Inc. (“Credit Bureaus”) or any other credit
						reporting company. You understand and agree that,
						pursuant to such authorization, CB may access your
						credit profile, including without limitation, your
						credit report, credit score(s) and other related
						information, to, among other things, verify your
						identity and to provide credit monitoring, credit
						scoring, credit score monitoring and tracking, or alerts

						understand and agree that CB receives compensation for
						the marketing of credit opportunities or other products

						GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES
					</h2>
					<p className="my-5">
						The Services and Websites are meant to provide you a
						means to review your personal and business finance
						and/or credit information for educational purposes only,
						and to manage if and to the extent you so choose, and
						may notify you of commercial credit opportunities and
						other products and services that may be available to you
						and your business entity through CB or through third
						parties (such as, among other things, advertisements or
						offers for available credit cards, loan options,
						educational products, business products or services, or
						credit related products or services and other offers to
						you and/or your business entity, the ability to track
						and collect certain credit information specific to you
						and/or your business entity, including but not limited
						to, credit score, loan and credit card monthly payment,
						total amount and interest rates). The Services and
						Websites are meant for you and your business’s use only.
						The Services and Websites may also provide you other
						third-party products or services. This includes
						receiving offers free of charge for various credit or
						other financial products or services based upon your
						self-identified credit attributes, the attributes of
						your business entity (and/or your consumer report and
						credit score and business entity’s commercial credit
						report and score). These offers may also be generic and
						may not contain offers based on information specific to
						you or your business entity.
					</p>
					<p className="my-5">
						CB will identify those Services that are provided to you
						free of charge. Some of the Services (including Premium
						and Premium Plus) require a fee at the time of Service
						purchase or enrollment. By purchasing such Services and
						providing payment information, you represent that you
						are authorized to utilize the payment method presented
						and agree to pay the specified fee for paid Services,
						including any method offered or used through a mobile
						application. Furthermore, you agree and authorize CB to:
						(i) submit a transaction using the card information
						provided, (ii) in the case of automatic recurring
						transactions, submit a transaction on a recurring basis
						(e.g. monthly or annual basis) for membership renewals.
					</p>
					<p className="my-5">
						If at any time you have a paid account with CB, you may
						choose to downgrade your membership to a different
						Service plan, including a free Service. You may
						downgrade your account by contacting Customer Support or
						by using any other method specified on the Websites. For
						the sake of clarity, downgrading your account will not
						cancel your membership. To cancel your account in its
						entirety and no longer receive Services, you must cancel
						your account by contacting Customer Support or by using
						the method specified on the Websites and expressly
						cancel your account to no longer receive such Service.
						In all events, your account with CB, (including your
						access to and use of any Services and Websites, and
						regardless of whether you upgrade or downgrade any
						Services while maintaining your account), shall be
						governed by this Agreement and these Terms and
						Conditions.
					</p>
					<p className="my-5">
						You acknowledge and agree that CB (including its
						Services and/or Websites) has not and does not provide
						you or your business entity, legal, tax, financial, or
						other advice (including, without limitation, advice on
						how to improve or repair your credit or credit scores),
						and that its Services and/or Websites are not designed
						or intended to provide any such advice. As discussed
						above, and for your convenience, we may provide various
						other third-party websites that may be of interest to
						you. The third party offers or links that may be
						displayed on a website are from third party companies
						from which CB may receive compensation. Compensation may
						impact how, where or whether a third party product,
						service or link appears on a website. Further, CB does
						not represent, warrant or guarantee approval of any loan
						offer or service offered by a third party on any Website
						or other benefit should you choose to apply for a
						particular offer. Any suggestion or representation of
						possible approval are for illustrative purposes only and
						may vary based on your individual and business entity’s
						financial circumstances and the terms made available to
						you by the applicable issuer or lender. CB disclaims all
						liability for any errors or omissions in any express or
						implied suggestions or representations related to
						possible approvals or benefits made by CB or its
						marketing partners. For complete information on any
						particular offer, see the terms and conditions on the
						issuer or lender’s website. Once you click apply for any
						offers, you will be directed to the issuer or lender’s
						website where you may review the terms and conditions of
						the applicable opportunity or offer before applying.

						accurate information, we show a summary to help you

						<p>Arbitration Agreement:</p>
					</h2>

					<p className="my-5">
						(a) CB and you agree to arbitrate all disputes and
						claims between us, except any disputes or claims which
						under governing law are not subject to arbitration. This
						agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly
						interpreted and to make all disputes and claims between
						us subject to arbitration to the fullest extent
						permitted by law. It includes, but is not limited to:
						claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the
						relationship between us, whether based in contract,
						tort, statute (including, without limitation, the Credit
						Repair Organizations Act) fraud, misrepresentation or
						any other legal theory; claims that arose before this or
						any prior Agreement (including, but not limited to,
						claims relating to advertising); claims that are
						currently the subject of purported class action
						litigation in which you are not a member of a certified
						class; and claims that may arise after the termination
						of this Agreement.
					</p>
					<p className="my-5">
						For purposes of this arbitration provision, references
						to “CB,” “you,” and “us” shall include our respective
						parent entities, subsidiaries, affiliates, agents,
						employees, predecessors in interest, successors and
						assigns, websites of the foregoing, as well as all
						authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of
						services, products or information under this or prior
						Agreements between us. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
						either party may bring an individual action in small
						claims court. You agree that, by entering into this
						Agreement, you and CB are each waiving the right to a
						trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This
						Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate
						commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs
						the interpretation and enforcement of this arbitration
						provision. This arbitration provision shall survive
						termination of this Agreement.
					</p>

					<p className="my-5">
						(b) A party who intends to seek arbitration must first
						send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice
						of Dispute (“Notice”). The Notice to CB should be
						addressed to: Legal & Compliance, CB, 9315 Trinana
						Circle in Winter Garden, Florida 34787. The Notice must
						describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute
						and set forth the specific relief you seek from CB
						(“Demand”). If CB and you do not reach an agreement to
						resolve the claim within 30 days after the Notice is
						received, you or CB may commence arbitration
						proceedings. During the arbitration, the amount of any
						settlement offer made by CB or you shall not be
						disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator
						determines the amount, if any, to which you or CB is
						entitled.
					</p>

					<p className="my-5">
						You may obtain more information about arbitration from {" "}
						<a
							className="underline text-blue-700"
							href="https://www.adr.org"
							target="_blank"
						>
							www.adr.org
						</a>
						.
					</p>

					<p className="my-5">
						(c) After CB receives notice at the Notice Address that
						you have commenced arbitration, it will promptly
						reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee. (The
						filing fee currently is $125 for claims under $10,000,
						but is subject to change by the arbitration provider. If
						you are unable to pay this fee, CB will pay it directly
						upon receiving a written request at the Notice Address.)
						The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial
						Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary
						Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively,
						“AAA Rules”) of the American Arbitration Association
						(“AAA”), as modified by this Agreement, and will be
						administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules are available
						online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at
						1-800-778-7879, or by writing to the Notice Address.
					</p>

					<p className="my-5">
						All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including
						the scope and enforceability of this arbitration
						provision as well as the Agreement´s other terms and
						conditions, and the arbitrator shall have exclusive
						authority to resolve any such dispute relating to the
						scope and enforceability of this arbitration provision
						or any other term of this Agreement including, but not
						limited to any claim that all or any part of this
						arbitration provision or Agreement is void or voidable.
						The arbitrator shall be bound by the terms of this
						Agreement. Unless CB and you agree otherwise, any
						arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or
						parish) of your billing address. If your claim is for
						$10,000 or less, we agree that you may choose whether
						the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of
						documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a
						telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as
						established by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds
						$10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by
						the AAA Rules. Except as otherwise provided herein, CB
						will pay all AAA filing, administration and arbitrator
						fees for any arbitration initiated in accordance with
						the notice requirements above. If, however, the
						arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim
						or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or
						brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the
						standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure
						11(b), then the payment of all such fees will be
						governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, you agree to
						reimburse CB for all monies previously disbursed by it
						that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA
						Rules. (d) The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve
						disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees and
						expenses at any time during the proceeding or in the
						final award, pursuant to applicable Florida State law
						and the AAA Rules.
					</p>

					<p className="my-5">
						(e) Discovery and/or the exchange of non-privileged
						information relevant to the dispute will be governed by
						the AAA Rules.
					</p>

					<p className="my-5">
						(f) YOU AND CB AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST
						THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND
						NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED
						CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both
						you and CB agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not
						consolidate more than one person’s claims and may not
						otherwise preside over any form of a representative or
						class proceeding. The arbitrator may award injunctive
						relief only in favor of the individual party seeking
						relief and only to the extent necessary to provide
						relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. If
						this specific subparagraph (f) is found to be
						unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration
						provision shall be null and void.
					</p>

					<p className="my-5">
						(g) Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to
						the contrary, we agree that if CB makes any change to
						this arbitration provision (other than a change to the
						Notice Address) during your membership in any credit
						monitoring or other product, you may reject any such
						change and require CB to adhere to the language in this
						provision if a dispute between us arises regarding such
						membership product.

					</ul>

					<p className="my-5">
						The FCRA also permits consumers to dispute inaccurate
						information in their consumer credit report without
						charge. Accurate information cannot be changed. You do
						not have to purchase your credit report or other
						information from CB to dispute inaccurate or incomplete
						information in your consumer credit file or to receive a
						copy of your consumer disclosure.
					</p>

					<p className="my-5">
						The credit report you are requesting from CB is not
						intended to constitute the disclosure of consumer credit
						information required by the FCRA or similar state laws.
						Such consumer disclosures must be obtained directly from
						one or all the three national credit reporting companies
						(Experian, Equifax, Transunion).
					</p>

					<p className="my-5">
						The FCRA allows consumers to get one free comprehensive
						disclosure of all of the information in their credit
						file from each of the three national credit reporting
						companies (Experian, Equifax®, and TransUnion®) once
						every 12 months through a central source. Georgia
						residents can receive two disclosures per year. Although
						comprehensive, the credit reports from one or all three
						national credit reporting companies that are available
						from CB may not have the same information as a credit
						report obtained directly from the three national credit
						reporting companies or through the central source. To
						request your free annual report under the FCRA, you must
						go to www.annualcreditreport.com, or call 877-322-8228.
						CB’s Products are not related to the free FCRA
						disclosure that you are or may be entitled to.

						<p>
							Consumers Have the Right to Obtain A Security Freeze
						</p>
					</h2>

					<p className="my-5">
						You have a right to place a “security freeze” on your
						credit report, which will prohibit a consumer reporting
						agency from releasing information in your credit report
						without your express authorization. The security freeze
						is designed to prevent credit, loans, and services from
						being approved in your name without your consent.
						However, you should be aware that using a security
						freeze to take control over who gets access to the
						personal and financial information in your credit report
						may delay, interfere with, or prohibit the timely
						approval of any subsequent request or application you
						make regarding a new loan, credit, mortgage, or any
